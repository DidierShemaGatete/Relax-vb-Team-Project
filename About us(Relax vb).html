            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>The Relax Volleyball Team was founded in 2008 by a group of friends who wanted to continue playing volleyball after their professional years. The team started as a small group of five players who met once a week to play and socialize. As word spread about the team, more players joined and the team became more organized with scheduled practices and games.</p>
            <p>Today, the Relax Volleyball Team has over 50 members and participates in various leagues and tournaments around the country and beyond. We have built a strong reputation for our sportsmanship, teamwork, socialization and dedication both on and off the court.</p>
